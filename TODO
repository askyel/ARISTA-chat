- We copied over the forking server code, but we're still figuring out
client to client connection, which prob requires networking
- We also found login code that hides your password when you type it

1/15/16
- Implemented the networking stuff, the chat almost works but it is between
the server and client
- Progress on login function and general interface

1/21/16
- Finished chat function over network connection
	- needs testing stil
	- need to make sure it can handle more than one client
- Debugged login function so that the never-ending loops actually end :D
	- need to use validation for username/password

- Login: working on reading from file to check for correct password
- Server: chat works between two clients, working on specifically connecting a tutee with a tutor
- Eventually need to connect login and client!
